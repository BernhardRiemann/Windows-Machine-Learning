# YOLOv4 Object Detection Sample

This UWP C# app uses the YOLOv4 model to detect objects in video streams. 

The [YOLOv4 model](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite) is trained with [Tensorflow-DML](https://github.com/microsoft/tensorflow-directml), and converted to ONNX through [tf2onnx](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx)
